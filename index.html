<h2><b>Quality of Life</b></h2>
<p>Crafting inside your house pulls materials from your Storage</p>
<p>Crafting available in bulk</p>
<p>Paths can overlap 1 tile within placed buildings and structures, eliminating the grass strip between buildings and paths if desired</p>
<p>Paths can be placed with the option of being fully adjacent to paths of different types, eliminating the grass strip between path materials if desired</p>
<p>Paths can be adjusted to form true diagonals, not just curves</p>
<p>Allow for placement of interior wall items on exterior cliffs</p>
<p>Allow for double or triple-high cliffs</p>
<p>Bridges can be placed over gaps in cliffs, not just over water</p>
<p><del>Catalogue includes sorting options to exclude crafted and otherwise not available for purchase items, or to show only those types of items</del></p>
<p>During the morning announcements, Isabelle now announces all wandering and visiting NPCs</p>
<p>Interactive Storage items can be placed outside for remote Storage access without needing to return to your home to store or return items</p>
<p>Fences now visually attach themselves to adjacent buildings to provide a cleaner look</p>
<p>Certain wandering NPCs (such as Sahara) and certain Plaza NPCs (such as Crazy Redd) will sometimes randomly appear on Nook Miles Tours if they are not currently visiting your island</p>
<p>Place rugs outside, they follow the orientation that you are facing when you place them from your inventory</p>
</p>
<h2><b>Buildings</b></h2>
<h3><b>New Buildings</b></h3>
<p><b>Kicks</b>
<ul>
  <li>Shopkeeper: Kicks</li>
  <li>After buying enough from him when he visits, he will ask you to place his shop a la the Able Sisters</li>
  <li>Daily-refreshed selection of socks, shoes, bags and backpacks</li>
  <li>Sells gloves! These cover your hands and wrists</li>
  <li>Sells capes and other back/shoulder accessories! These take your backpack slot and can help complete knight's outfits or for accenting a royal or superhero outfit</li>
  <li>After building his shop, Socks and Shoes will be removed from the Able Sisters' shop so they can have a wider variety of items (still same number of items/day, just from a smaller pool so you see more of it)</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Garden Emporium</b>
<ul>
  <li>Shopkeeper: Leif</li>
  <li>After earning a 2-star Island, Isabelle will prompt you to invite him to the island and to place his store</li>
  <li>Sells flower seeds, saplings, and a returning plant type from New Leaf: bushes</li>
  <li>Once unlocked, the cabinet in the General Store will stop selling flower seeds and saplings to help clear out future clutter from the UI</li>
  <li>Sells Tree Trimming Patterns that will allow you to shape an existing, fully grown tree into a different style</li>
  <li>Sells interior plants and landscaping accents, such as rocks and low fences</li>
  <li>Sells large tree saplings that need a 2x2 space to grow (you can see a few of these in the Museum)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>These need a lot of empty space around them to grow</li>
    <li>Growth of these trees takes about a month</li>
    <li>Once they are grown, they cannot be moved, only chopped down</li>
    <li>Once they are grown, things can be planted around them</li>
  </ul>
  <li>This building will upgrade when you reach a 5-Star Island, allowing you access to the new second floor: a Greenhouse</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This greenhouse has space for one of every single type of plantable tree, shrub, and flower</li>
    <li>Flowers planted in the greenhouse are on raised rows and therefore cannot be walked upon or plucked/watered/interacted with - they are always safe</li>
    <li>Donate fully grown flowers/shrubs/trees by interacting with empty spaces (similar to how the Furnish a House quest worked)</li>
    <li>This has no real purpose other than to show off your flower breeding collection</li>
  </ul>
</ul></p>
<p><b>ReTail</b>
<ul>
  <li>Shopkeepers: Reese and Cyrus</li>
  <li>Unlock by having a certain number of DIY recipes learned</li>
  <li>Contains 4 raised lots within that you can use to sell your furniture, DIY recipes, and clothing items to other villagers and visitors, allowing you to collect payment directly to your ABD if it sells</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Items may be set for any price, with an option to "Sell for Catalogue Fee"</li>
    <li>Listings may also be set to only allow players to purchase the items instead of both players and animals, and to restrict player purchases to your Friends or Best Friends only</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Animals in your town will occasionally list their completed DIY furniture items for sale in empty lots</li>
  <li>Includes new cabinet that sells the DIY recipes that would be sold in the cabinet of the General Store, as well as a daily-rotating selection of DIY recipes from the general pool. This means that the DIY recipes are moved from the Nook Store to here.</li>
  <li>Trade in DIY recipes you already know for ReTail Tickets, and then exchange them for event recipes during a seasonal event</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Recipes you can turn in do not include generic nook-bought recipes such as Flimsy Tools or Event Recipes like Bunny Day furniture</li>
    <li>Limit 1/day recipe gathered in this way</li>
  </ul>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Cafe</b>
<ul>
  <li>Shopkeeper: Brewster</li>
  <li>Your villagers can loiter here to pass the time</li>
  <li>Contains exterior portion that you can place certain types of usable furniture on</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This exterior portion may sometimes be used by off-duty NPCs - such as Kicks after he closes for the night- and are a good way to get some idle chat in with NPCs that otherwise have very restricted dialogue (such as Sable)</li>
    <li>This can happen a max of 1/week and will advance each NPC’s personal plot (a la Sable) - so if Kicks is there one night he won’t be back until the following Monday or later.</li>
    <li>Wandering NPCs will stay here when another player is present in Online Mode for ease of use - no more searching a friend's town for Daisy Mae or Celeste! These NPCs will go back to their randomly wandering routines when you return to single player or local multiplayer mode</li>
    <li>Visiting Campers may also loiter here during the day instead of being confined to their tent</li>
  </ul>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Post Office</b>
<ul>
  <li>Pelly and Phyllis return as Post Office workers, Pete returns as mail carrier (you can occasionally chat with him in the Brewsters or find him when he's delivering mail)</li>
  <li>This building's interior contains another ABD</li>
  <li>Unlocking this building shifts mail services here from the Airport, and unlocks sophisticated mail controls</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Send more than one item at a time to another player</li>
    <li>Send bells directly from your ABD to another player</li>
    <li>Send an item or items from your inventory with a Cash on Delivery fee</li>
    <ul>
      <li>These CoD letters may be accepted or declined by the recipient, at which point either the sale is made or the item is returned</li>
      <li>The CoD fee may be set to the Catalogue Value of the item or a custom amount</li>
      <li>This letter type may also be sent via a single-use code to facilitate online trading. If not claimed/returned within 24 hours, the letter is automatically declined and the item is returned</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Send an item or items from your inventory as a Trade Request</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The recipient may either decline or send their own offer, at which point the sender may either accept or decline</li>
      <li>This letter type may also be sent via a single-use code to facilitate online trading. If an agreement is not made within 24 hours, the offer is automatically declined and items are returned</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Send a pattern or Pro Design via the mail, which will give the recipient an option to either save the pattern or discard it</li>
    <li>Provides a mail archive service that keeps a record of every letter sent on a scrollable timeline for idle perusal</li>
  </ul>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Shampoodle</b>
<ul>
  <li>Shopkeeper: Harriet</li>
  <li>This is an upgrade to the Able Sister's Shop and is accessible from the building's interior via a staircase</li>
  <li>Unlock many more Shampoodle-exclusive hairstyles and the ability to use a color-picker for your hair color</li>
  <li>Purchase specialty wigs from a small side shop table (this will remove Wigs from the general rotation of the Able Sisters)</li>
  <li>Purchase and unlock hair gradients and special hair colors</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Hair gradients are hair colors that contain two or more colors, such as:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Brown fading to green at the tips</li>
      <li>Black fading to gray and then to white at the tips</li>
      <li>Brown hair with a white streak from the temple</li>
      <li>Blonde hair with bright red tips</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Special hair colors are rare and unique patterns that can change depending on the situation, such as:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Sparkly gold that shimmers in the sunlight</li>
      <li>Flowing rainbow hair that slowly shifts its pattern</li>
      <li>Hair that changes color with the time of day or weather</li>
      <li>Hair that changes with proximity to water or elevation</li>
      <li>Hair that looks like flowing lava</li>
      <li>Hair that looks like flowing water</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Observatory</b>
<ul>
  <li>Shopkeeper: Celeste</li>
  <li>3x3 building - Must be placed on a Tier 4 Cliff Wall. You need to face a Tier 4 cliff with enough space behind it to place it “above” the rest of the town. </li>
  <li>Sells Museum and Star-themed furniture</li>
  <li>Celeste can make models of complete sets of Fossils if you bring them to her - similar to how Bug and Fish models work with Flick and CJ</li>
  <li>When a Meteor Shower happens or shooting stars can fall, she will close early and wander around like she does now to hand out Celestial DIY Recipes - the “closed!” sign is also an easy way to tell if she’s wandering around and stars will be happening that night</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Fortune-Teller's</b>
<ul>
  <li>Shopkeeper: Katrina</li>
  <li>She can rate each player's Luck once-daily</li>
  <li>She will also rate an interior's feng shui once per week via mail, a la HHA</li>
  <li>Player can meet her randomly on mystery island where her tent is stationed to get their luck rated (1/day). Do this enough times and she will offer to move to your town</li>
  <li>You can pay her a lot of Bells to change the weather in your town for a certain amount of time - for example, players can ask her to "Make it thunderstorm!" or to "Clear the skies!"</li>
  <li>You can also pay her to turn counterfeit art into real art for several times the cost of the real art</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Resetti Cave</b>
<ul>
  <li>Place by facing a cliff wall - makes a door in a cliff that has enough space behind it</li>
  <li>Resetti has a command center here that can give you all sorts of listed stats (because he’s spying on everyone)</li>
  <li>Stats include:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>How many gifts given (per Villager currently on the island)</li>
    <li>How many islands visited (nook miles or otherwise)</li>
    <li>How many hours/minutes/seconds spent</li>
    <li>Squares terraformed</li>
    <li>Just basically everything a player can do</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Bug and Bait Shop</b>
<ul>
  <li>Shopkeepers: CJ and Flick</li>
  <li>They will offer to move into your General Store once enough Fish and Bugs are donated to the museum</li>
  <li>This is an add-on section to a Level 3+ General Store and a requirement to further upgrade the General Store to Levels 4+ (kind of like Gracie with New Leaf)</li>
  <li>CJ and Flick rotate who is working on shift each day</li>
  <li>Every day, whoever is on shift has a list of 2 "Hot Fish/Bugs" that they will buy for 150% asking price - this will match the shopkeeper, meaning that Flick will always ask for bugs and CJ will always ask for fish</li>
  <li>This section sells tools and upgraded tools from their own cabinet, clearing some of the clutter from the main cabinet</li>
</ul></p>
<h3><b>Current Buildings</b></h3>
<p><b>Museum</b>
<ul>
  <li>Observatory on the top floor, as above</li>
  <li>Unlock the Fine Art wing once the General Store is upgraded to Level 3+</li>
  <li>Fine art (and counterfeits!) are purchaseable from Crazy Redd (a new Plaza NPC) and from Level 3+ General Stores</li>
  <li>Blathers can now show you a checklist of items donated/missing in each wing to easily determine how close you are to museum completion</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This checklist is ordered the same across all islands - for example, if you're missing Fossil 9, it is always the T-Rex Skull</li>
  </ul>
  <li>When each of the four wings of the Museum is completed, a corresponding banner will lower on the building exterior so you can easily show off your achievement</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Able Sisters</b>
<ul>
  <li>Complete enough challenges perfectly for Label to have her move back in and expand the ground floor of the Able Sisters</li>
  <li>Adds a ton of new outfits and costumes to the rotation, including new color variants of currently existing or purchaseable clothing items</li>
  <li>When Kicks sets up his shop, all shoes and socks are removed from rotation and placed in his to allow for a wider variety of daily options</li>
  <li>When Shampoodle opens upstairs, all wigs are removed from rotation and placed upstairs to allow for a wider variety of daily options</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>General Store</b>
<ul>
  <li>Adds two or three more upgrade levels to this building, each level unlocking more furniture sale slots and more furniture sets in the pool of items to be sold</li>
  <li>At Level 3+, Fine Art may rarely be found in the 4th furniture sale slot</li>
  <li>At all levels, now allows you to preview wallpaper and flooring</li>
  <li>Saplings, flowers, DIY recipes, and tools removed from the cabinet and dispersed to their own stores/sections to keep clutter down</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Airport</b>
<ul>
  <li>Rather than asking you several questions in a row, Orville now hands you a form to fill out that will quickly let you select your desired options with as few button-presses as possible and less of a chance of misclicks</li>
  <li>This form will also let you simply pay 2000 miles to go on an adventure if no Nook Miles ticket is in your inventory</li>
  <li>The TV in the corner of the airport can be used to show a brief overview of the "Available Flights" so you can quickly see whose island is open and to whom among your Switch friends.</li>
  <li>Entering or leaving a town will not play the full cinematic if a third player is present - so a host would only see the cutscene once and then never again, and a visitor would only see the cinematic if they are entering a previously-visitor-free island</li>
</ul></p>
<h2><b>Structures and Terraforming</b></h2>
<p><b>New type of Water Terraforming: Low Pool</b>
<ul>
  <li>Second type of water - access by applying water to a tile and then applying water again</li>
  <li>Low Pool is water that can be waded in without a swimsuit. It cannot be dived in. Your character will be unable to run while wading.</li>
  <li>You cannot place items in a Low Pool or on a low pool slope</li>
  <li>Bridges over a low pool are visually much lower and do not arch - closer to how wooden bridges look than Zen Bridges - and are only 1 walkable tile wide (2 tiles across, with .5 impassable tiles as the edges, 1 tile in the middle)</li>
  <li>As low pools get bigger, a beach rim will automatically form around the bottom and side edges. You can only enter or exit a low pool from the beach slope areas, not the top.</li>
  <li>Low Pools cannot form waterfalls, but waterfalls can enter into Low Pools</li>
  <li>Certain plants can be planted in low pools</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Bushes will turn into different types of tall grass</li>
    <li>Bamboo will turn into cattails</li>
    <li>Flowers will turn into a lily pad with a single flower of the appropriate type on it</li>
    <li>Weeds will turn into a plain Lily Pad</li>
  </ul>
</ul></p>
<p><b>New type of Path Terraforming: Cliff and Water Edge customization</b>
<ul>
  <li>Apply by using the path tool over a Water tile, a Low Pool tile, or a cliff face from the bottom or the top</li>
  <li>This will change the sides of the impassable terrain</li>
  <li>Water Tile will change the edge type of the water tile to match the selected path. Only some paths are eligible for this.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Dirt Path: default, looks as it normally does</li>
    <li>Stone Path: rocky cliff</li>
    <li>Dark Dirt path: darker dirt</li>
    <li>Grass path/path removal: Longer grass covering that goes to the water’s edge</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Low Pool will change the type of slope into the sides and bottom of the Low Pool</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Sand path: default. Looks like a sandy beach.</li>
    <li>Dirt path: dirt slope</li>
    <li>Dark dirt path: dark dirt slope</li>
    <li>Stone: rocky floor with no dirt</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Cliff Top will change the edgework around the top of the cliff</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Dirt: default</li>
    <li>Stone: ornate rim of blocked, large stones, ideal for a ruins</li>
    <li>Brick: decorative brick edgework</li>
    <li>Angled Stone: smaller stones, very detailed</li>
    <li>etc</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Cliff bottom will change the actual cliff wall itself (and go up as high as the cliff does in the case of a double or triple-high cliff</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Dirt: default</li>
    <li>Stone: rocky wall</li>
    <li>Brick: brick wall</li>
    <li>etc</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</p>

  <li>New bridge models available to build, including some that are crafted from single-use DIY recipes or unlocked at moments of story progression</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Living wood covered in leaves and vines that change with the season</li>
    <li>Flower-covered options of existing bridges, in either your town's natural wildflower pattern or in rarer variants that require the appropriately colored/typed hybrids to build</li>
    <li>Stone gothica that would match a Halloween town aesthetic</li>
    <li>Natural stone crossing that looks like a series of stones across a low section of a creekbed, ideal for a natural crossing in an undeveloped area - this would not be placable across cliffs</li>
    <li>Solid gold</li>
    <li>Futuristic teleporters or portals that instantly blink you across the river or cliff</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Change a previously-built bridge into a new style by paying the difference in costs - if the new style costs less, this process is free and you are not awarded the difference</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Inclines</b>
<ul>
  <li>New incline models available to build, including some that are crafted from single-use DIY recipes or unlocked at moments of story progression</li>
  <ul>

    <li>Flower-covered options of existing inclines, in either your town's natural wildflower pattern or in rarer variants that require the appropriately colored/typed hybrids to build</li>
    <li>Stone gothica that would match a Halloween town aesthetic</li>
    <li>Solid gold</li>
    <li>Futuristic teleporters or portals that instantly blink you to the top of the incline</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Change a previously-built incline into a new style by paying the difference in costs - if the new style costs less, this process is free and you are not awarded the difference</li>
  <li>Available styles are also available in two-cliffs-high versions that follow the same aesthetic but either double-back upon themselves to reach the desired elevation or spiral around</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Paths</b>
<ul>
  <li>New path patterns available to place, including some that are crafted from single-use DIY recipes or unlocked at moments of story progression</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Worn down/rugged dirt that lets a lot of the grass show through and features a much deeper fringe grass border</li>
    <li>Fallen leaves paths:</li>

      <li>Cedar/Pine leaves</li>
      <li>Spruce/Fruit Tree leaves</li>
      <li>Palm leaves</li>
      <li>Cherry Blossom leaves (seasonal unlock)</li>
      <li>Bright fall leaves (seasonal unlock)</li>
      <li>Dirt Patch - this will fill space to match the original Animal Crossing dirt clearing shapes. As you expand a large chunk of this path outwards, it will fill out the most circular or round-ish shape it can fit within the area</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Black, white, and brown natural stone</li>
    <li>Solid gold</li>
    <li>Futuristic, sleek metal</li>

    <li>Paths can be placed with the option of being fully adjacent to paths of different types, eliminating the grass strip between path materials if desired</li>
    <li>Paths can be adjusted to form true diagonals, not just curves</li>
  </ul>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Statue</b>
<ul>
  <li>Once you finish your last loan, you may place and build 2x2 structures that are a life-sized, stone statue of your character</li>
  <li>This is a structure, so you may place more than one on your island</li>
  <li>You can pay to set a new pose and outfit from your Wand outfits, a la the housing exterior menu</li>
  <li>You can also redeem Nook Miles for small copies of this statue in gold, silver, and stone</li>
</ul></p>
